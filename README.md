First foray using beautiful soup for scrapping data

TO DO: to create various functions to parse thru the links and return the values as csv files. Right now it's hardcoded to just take the first index of each result. 

 change this to a different value manually for this moment. 
 url1 = mainLinkdf[0].iloc[0]
 url1dept = url1min1df[0].iloc[1]
